Several local scale studies showed a general increase in cropped areas since the 1950s and in recent years a few studies have indicated that cropland has a higher annual NDVI than savanna in Sahelian areas supporting a possible link between cropland expansion cropping intensification and the observed positive trends in NDVI,9,0,2,1,4,0,2,0,0,0,0

The tropical forest zone in West Africa has experienced centuries of human modification leading to a substantial decline in forest cover and loss of forest biodiversity,6,0,1,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0
