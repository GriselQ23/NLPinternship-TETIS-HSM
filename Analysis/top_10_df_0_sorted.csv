The specific research questions are What are the patterns of peri urban development and differences between northern and southern Ghana using Bolgatanga as an example for the north and Takoradi as an example for the south What are the determinants of urban development for both study areas Which conclusions can be drawn for land use planning What are the current opportunities and challenges of land use planning and how can they be linked to urban sprawl What are the dis advantages of a mixed method approach to analyse peri urban land use patterns The analysis of the dynamics of urban and peri urban areas from a social science perspective introduces reasoning of human behaviour and provides a background of historical cultural and social development e.g,20,0,4,0,5,6,1,0,4,0,0

How do crop rotations with legumes and which legumes affect N availability and use efficiency differently in CA compared to conventional systems Does increased N use efficiency translate into reductions in the amount of fertilizer N needed to attain the same yields as with conventional agriculture Do the different patterns of N availability increased immobilization and slower release with CA result in decreased N leaching Currently there are opposing processes that have been proposed one that less available N results in less leaching and another that increased macropore continuity with CA will lead to increased losses of N through leaching,11,0,0,5,0,3,0,0,3,0,0

From the Earth Observation EO perspective a successful differentiation between cropped and fallowed fields is required to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and drivers of observed NDVI trends in relation to changes in the spatio temporal patterns of crop fallow rotation due to cropping expansion abandonment,10,0,1,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0
