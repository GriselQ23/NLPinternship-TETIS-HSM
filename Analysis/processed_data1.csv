Several local scale studies showed a general increase in cropped areas since the 1950s and in recent years a few studies have indicated that cropland has a higher annual NDVI than savanna in Sahelian areas supporting a possible link between cropland expansion cropping intensification and the observed positive trends in NDVI,1,4,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,12
